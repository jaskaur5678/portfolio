  <!-- My Journey in DSA Section Start -->

      <div class="title"><span>My Journey in DSA</span></div>
      <div class="dsa-details">
        <p>
          My journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) has been both challenging and rewarding. Starting from the basics of arrays and linked lists, I gradually progressed to more complex structures like trees and graphs. Along the way, I have honed my problem-solving skills and developed a deeper understanding of computational efficiency. My continuous practice and application of DSA concepts have not only enhanced my technical expertise but also boosted my confidence in tackling complex algorithmic challenges. As I continue to learn and grow in this field, I am committed to mastering more advanced topics and algorithms.Progressing further, I explored binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs), which introduced me to hierarchical data storage and retrieval. Understanding these structures paved the way for my work with heaps (useful for priority-based tasks) and balanced trees like AVL trees, where I learned to optimize insertion, deletion, and lookup operations. Graph theory was particularly exciting; through studying graph representations, DFS (Depth First Search), BFS (Breadth First Search), and algorithms like Dijkstra's for shortest paths, I gained insights into solving real-world problems such as routing, networking, and recommendation systems. In parallel, I devoted significant time to understanding and implementing sorting and searching algorithms. By practicing with algorithms like merge sort, quick sort, and binary search, I enhanced my skills in dividing problems for faster computation, which has become a core part of my approach to efficient coding.A crucial part of my journey has been focusing on complexity analysis. I am proficient in Big O notation, and continuously assess the time and space complexity of my solutions, always seeking to balance efficiency with performance. This understanding has allowed me to tackle large-scale data challenges confidently, choosing the right data structures for each unique problem.
